In the previous exercises, the user lookup API requires no parameters to be passed in to 
make the API call. However, some API calls (such as checkout API) require more 
information from you to complete the API call. Imagine the user API call is like having your 
wallet--you don't need any credentials to access your money. The checkout API is like 
visiting the bank to withdraw money--you need to show credentials (such as an ID card) to 
gain access to your money.

But what do you do when the API does require a parameters to be passed in?

We'll be using the checkout API in this example. The checkout API is used for charging your
customer. The creation of a checkout object requires parameters, and here we'll show you 
how to add parameters to your API call.

If you were to look at the documentation for the checkout/create/ API, you'll noticed 4 
required parameters (accountid, shortdescription, type, and amount).

Lines 9-14 show you how to add these required parameters to your API call. Require 
parameters mean that these values must always be passed in when you are making that API 
call.
