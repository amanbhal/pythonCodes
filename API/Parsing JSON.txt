JSON (which stands for JavaScript Object Notation) is an alternative to XML. It gets its 
name from the fact that its data format resembles JavaScript objects, and it is often more 
succinct than the equivalent XML. For instance, our same <pet> Jeffrey would look like this 
in JSON:

{
  "pets": {
    "name": "Jeffrey",
    "species": "Giraffe"
  }
}
