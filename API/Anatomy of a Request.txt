An HTTP request is made up of three parts:

1. The request line, which tells the server what kind of request is being sent (GET, POST, 
etc.) and what resource it's looking for;

2. The header, which sends the server additional information (such as which client is making
 the request)

3. The body, which can be empty (as in a GET request) or contain data (if you're POSTing 
or PUTing information, that information is contained here).
