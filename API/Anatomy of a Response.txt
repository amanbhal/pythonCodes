The HTTP response structure mirrors that of the HTTP request. It contains:

A response line (line 2), which includes the three-digit HTTP status code;

A header line or lines (line 3), which include further information about the server and its 
response;

The body (line 5 and line 6), which contains the text message of the response (for example, 
"404" would have "file not found" in its body).
