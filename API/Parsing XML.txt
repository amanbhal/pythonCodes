XML (which stands for eXtensible Markup Language) is very similar to HTML—it uses 
tags between angle brackets. The difference is that XML allows you to use tags that you 
make up, rather than tags that the W3C decided on. For instance, you could create an API 
that returns information about a pet:

<pet>
  <name>Jeffrey</name>
  <species>Giraffe</species>
</pet>
As long as you document the structure of your API's response, other people can use your 
API to get information about <pet>s.
