Charging a customer happens in three steps:

1. Create a checkout object to define the payment (amount, etc.) using the /checkout/create 
call. We'll go over how to use this call in the next exercise.

2. Get the customer’s payment information by sending them to the checkout_uri returned by
 the /checkout/create call.

3. Send the customer to a confirmation page.
