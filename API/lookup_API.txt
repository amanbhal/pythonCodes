Line 3 contains the url where the code will make a HTTP request to. This also specifies 
which API we're using. In this example, we're using the user API. The user API can be used 
to create, lookup, modify, and resend confirmation about a certain user. We will be using the 
"lookup" functionality of the user API.

Line 4 contains the HTTP headers that will be included in the request. They define the 
operating parameters of an HTTP transaction. They are not related to the WePay API and 
are a standard protocol in which the servers "talk" to each other.

Line 5 are optional parameters that you will pass to an API to further specify what you 
need. Some API calls require parameters in order for it to properly work. In the next 
exercise we'll show you how this works in further details.

Line 9 is using python's urllib2 library to make an HTTP call from your server to WePay's 
server at the specified url on line 3. The response variable will store anything received from 
WePay's server after the HTTP call.

The example is broken down for clarification and does NOT work; our API requires special 
keys/credentials. In the next exercise we'll show you how to put in your API credentials.
Lines 4-8 The headers are now adjusted to include some HTTP headers. Examine line 7, 
this is where you would put your access_token. The access token allows you to gain access 
to your account. It is sort of like a temporary password, so NEVER share it with anyone.

Note the url in line 3 is /user. You can read the full documentation about the /user API and 
all the optional parameters.
